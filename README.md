# GraspNeRF

Here is the code for our CSCI 2952-0 project. Along with our actual code to move the arm and train the NeRF in real time, a significant amount of effort went into setting up the necessary dependencies and packages on the PC in the robotics lab. The same code can be found on the PC in the panda_ws directory under motion_planning.
